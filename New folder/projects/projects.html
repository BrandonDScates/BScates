    <h3>A few years back I started playing Minecraft with my wife. It was fun, and we both enjoyed it. As I got deeper in my schoolwork
         I had less and less time to play games, so I quit paying for my subscription. It was not much for it. I just didn‚Äôt have the time.
          About a year after quitting, I learned that I could make my own server and not have to pay anyone for it. So, I did just that now
           whenever we want we can hope on and play. I have been working on adding mods to it as a fun little side project, but I have not
            successfully done it yet. At some point though I will have it so it will run with mods. I decided to add this little thing that
             shows when my server for my game is on.</h3>
